mlpack: a scalable C++ machine learning library


mlpack is an intuitive, fast, scalable C++ machine learning library, meant to be
a machine learning analog to LAPACK. It aims to implement a wide array of
machine learning methods and functions as a "swiss army knife" for machine
learning researchers.
